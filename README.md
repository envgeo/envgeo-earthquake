# EnvGeo-Earthquake

EnvGeo-Earthquake is an interactive platform for exploring earthquake
hypocenter catalogs in research and education.

[![Streamlit App](https://static.streamlit.io/badges/streamlit_badge_black_white.svg)](https://streamlit.io/)
[![Python](https://img.shields.io/badge/python-3.10--3.12-blue.svg)](https://www.python.org/)
[![License: MIT](https://img.shields.io/badge/License-MIT-yellow.svg)](LICENSE)

This application adapts the spatial 3D/4D visualization workflow of
**EnvGeo-Seawater** (https://envgeo.h.kyoto-u.ac.jp/sw_jpn/) to earthquake
catalog data. EnvGeo-Seawater was developed for interactive visualization of
oceanographic and marine geochemical datasets; EnvGeo-Earthquake applies the
same exploratory, source-aware approach to hypocenter catalogs.

The app is intended to support **exploratory data analysis**, teaching, and
reproducible research workflows. It is not an official earthquake alert,
tsunami warning, hazard assessment, or disaster-response system.

## Overview

EnvGeo-Earthquake fetches earthquake hypocenter data from the USGS Earthquake
Catalog API and visualizes the results through EnvGeo-style 2D, 3D, 4D, and
section-based workflows:

- 2D maps with marker size scaled by magnitude
- 3D/4D hypocenter plots with depth, magnitude, and colorbar controls
- arbitrary A-B cross-sections with a section-location map
- depth-frequency profiles
- time-series histograms
- Japan-focused comparison with uploaded JMA/NIED catalog tables in the Advanced page
- plate-boundary overlays from USGS where available

The project is also used as a testbed for identifying which parts of the
EnvGeo-Seawater workflow can become shared geoscience utilities, such as data
normalization, source-aware metadata handling, map presets, local coordinate
conversion, 3D/4D layout helpers, and cross-section tools.

## Main Pages

The Streamlit app uses `home.py` for the overview, data-source, manual,
update-log, and README tabs. The `pages/` directory contains English and
Japanese versions of the earthquake visualization workflows:

- `pages/54_🇺🇸_4D_Earthquake_Simple.py`
  English focused USGS hypocenter visualizer.

- `pages/55_🇺🇸_4D_Earthquake_Advanced.py`
  English advanced earthquake visualizer with plate boundaries, 2D/3D maps,
  cross-section, depth profile, time histogram, and JMA/NIED comparison tools.

- `pages/56_🇯🇵_4D_Earthquake_シンプル版.py`
  Japanese focused USGS hypocenter visualizer.

- `pages/57_🇯🇵_4D_Earthquake_詳細版.py`
  Japanese advanced earthquake visualizer with plate boundaries, 2D/3D maps,
  cross-section, depth profile, time histogram, and JMA/NIED comparison tools.

## Key Features

- USGS Earthquake Catalog API access using GeoJSON
- filters for UTC date/time, magnitude, hypocenter depth, latitude, longitude,
  order, and maximum event count
- main-screen region selection for Japan and surrounding area or global view
- magnitude-scaled marker size on 2D maps
- colorbar variable selection between magnitude and hypocenter depth
- EnvGeo-style 3D/4D view using local kilometer coordinates so horizontal
  scale is more physically meaningful than raw degree axes
- depth-axis scaling up to 1,000 km
- plate-boundary overlays from the USGS Tectonic Plate Boundaries service
- arbitrary cross-section and depth-profile tools
- map showing the selected A-B cross-section line and section width
- time-series histogram of earthquake occurrence
- CSV export of the selected USGS catalog records
- warning when the selected query reaches the 20,000-event API limit
- concise source and data-use notes in the app
- PC recommendation for 3D display and 2D recommendation for smartphones/tablets

## Relationship to EnvGeo-Seawater

EnvGeo-Earthquake is intentionally kept close to EnvGeo-Seawater in structure,
terminology, and visual workflow. The two applications currently remain
separate, but future refactoring should treat the following as candidates for a
shared EnvGeo core:

- standardized geoscience column names and unit conventions
- source and citation metadata displayed alongside data products
- map background, regional preset, and coastline helper functions
- longitude wrapping and local kilometer-coordinate conversion
- reusable 3D/4D layout helpers
- cross-section geometry and depth-profile workflows
- user-upload validation and comparison-table normalization

Earthquake-specific logic, such as USGS catalog queries, JMA/NIED comparison
details, hypocenter terminology, and seismic-source limitations, should remain
in the earthquake layer unless the same pattern is needed by other EnvGeo
applications.

## Data Sources and Attribution

### USGS Earthquake Catalog API

Primary earthquake hypocenter data are accessed from:

- USGS Earthquake Catalog API / FDSN Event Web Service  
  https://earthquake.usgs.gov/fdsnws/event/1/

The app uses the `query` method with:

- `format=geojson`
- `eventtype=earthquake`
- `starttime`
- `endtime`
- `minmagnitude`, `maxmagnitude`
- `mindepth`, `maxdepth`
- `minlatitude`, `maxlatitude`
- `minlongitude`, `maxlongitude`
- `orderby`
- `limit`

The USGS API documentation states that the service implements the FDSN Event
Web Service and supports query parameters for time, geographic bounds,
magnitude, depth, order, and a result limit. The service limit is 20,000 events;
the app therefore warns the user when a query reaches the selected limit.

- USGS Search Earthquake Catalog  
  https://earthquake.usgs.gov/earthquakes/search/
- USGS Latest Earthquakes  
  https://www.usgs.gov/tools/latest-earthquakes

### USGS data credit and preliminary-data note

USGS-authored or USGS-produced data and information are generally considered to
be in the U.S. public domain, and USGS requests proper credit when its products,
publications, or websites are used. However, earthquake catalog systems can
include information contributed by multiple networks or agencies, and some
non-USGS materials on USGS websites may have separate copyright restrictions.
For publication or redistribution, cite the USGS/ANSS catalog and also follow
any contributor-specific acknowledgement required by the specific catalog or
table being used.

- USGS Copyrights and Credits  
  https://www.usgs.gov/information-policies-and-instructions/copyrights-and-credits

Earthquake information can be preliminary and may be revised. This app therefore
states that earthquake data may be updated and that official agencies should be
used for emergency response and public-safety decisions.

- USGS Earthquake Notification Service disclaimer, included here as a related
  USGS note about preliminary earthquake information  
  https://earthquake.usgs.gov/ens/help_disclaimer

### Plate-boundary data

Plate-boundary overlays are loaded from:

- USGS Tectonic Plate Boundaries ArcGIS REST service  
  https://earthquake.usgs.gov/arcgis/rest/services/eq/map_plateboundaries/MapServer

The app uses:

- `Plates (1)`
- optional `Microplates (0)`

The USGS plate-boundary service metadata lists the following sources:

- USGS Seismicity of the Earth Map Series, as cited in the USGS service metadata  
  https://earthquake.usgs.gov/earthquakes/byregion/
- Bird, P. (2003). An updated digital model of plate boundaries.
  *Geochemistry, Geophysics, Geosystems*, 4(3), 52 pp.  
  https://doi.org/10.1029/2001GC000252
- DeMets, C., Gordon, R. G., & Argus, D. F. (2010). Geologically current
  plate motions. *Geophysical Journal International*, 181, 1-80.  
  https://doi.org/10.1111/j.1365-246X.2009.04491.x

Plate-boundary locations are approximate and are used as educational/research
context lines. They should not be used as official fault traces, hazard-zone
boundaries, or disaster-response information.

If the USGS plate-boundary service cannot be reached, the app can show a small
Japan-area fallback set of approximate schematic lines for trenches and troughs.
Those fallback lines are visual guides only and are not a formal dataset.

### JMA and NIED comparison data

The app does **not** automatically scrape JMA or NIED services. Instead, it
provides a comparison interface where the user can upload a catalog table
obtained and checked by the user.

Relevant official references:

- JMA Earthquake Information issued by Japan Meteorological Agency  
  https://www.data.jma.go.jp/eqev/data/en/guide/earthinfo.html
- JMA Seismological Bulletin of Japan  
  https://www.data.jma.go.jp/eqev/data/bulletin/index_e.html
- JMA Hypocenter file format  
  https://www.data.jma.go.jp/eqev/data/bulletin/data/format/fmthyp_e.html
- NIED Hi-net data guidance  
  https://www.hinet.bosai.go.jp/about_data/?LANG=en

NIED Hi-net guidance describes the automatic hypocenter catalog as a quick
report and advises users to refer to official JMA earthquake information. It
also notes that the JMA unified catalog is available through the Hi-net website
for registered users and recommends using the final JMA Seismological Bulletin
where appropriate.

Users are responsible for checking provider-specific terms, registration
requirements, acknowledgement requirements, and redistribution rules for any
JMA/NIED data they upload.

### Base maps and display layers

The app uses several map background styles through Plotly Mapbox layers:

- Standard map: Plotly/CARTO basemap style, based on CARTO basemaps and
  OpenStreetMap data attribution handled by the interactive map layer  
  https://carto.com/basemaps  
  https://www.openstreetmap.org/copyright
- Satellite map: USGS National Map imagery tiles  
  https://basemap.nationalmap.gov/arcgis/rest/services/USGSImageryOnly/MapServer
- Bathymetry map: Esri World Ocean Base tiles  
  https://services.arcgisonline.com/arcgis/rest/services/Ocean/World_Ocean_Base/MapServer
  Esri's Ocean Basemap attribution guidance should be followed for publication
  or static map exports.  
  https://support.esri.com/en-us/knowledge-base/what-is-the-correct-way-to-cite-an-arcgis-online-basema-000012040
- Contour/topographic map: Geospatial Information Authority of Japan (GSI) tiles  
  https://maps.gsi.go.jp/development/ichiran.html
  https://maps.gsi.go.jp/help/termsofuse.html



### Source certainty audit

The following status was checked against official or provider pages on
2026-05-04.

- USGS FDSN Event Web Service/API parameters, GeoJSON output,
  `eventtype=earthquake`, depth/magnitude/location/time filters, and the
  20,000-event service limit are documented by USGS.
- The ANSS Comprehensive Catalog citation and DOI
  `10.5066/F7MS3QZH` are listed by the FDSN USGS data-center record.
- The plate-boundary overlay is an official USGS ArcGIS REST
  service with `Plates (1)` and `Microplates (0)` layers. Its own metadata cites
  Bird (2003), DeMets et al. (2010), and the USGS Seismicity of the Earth Map
  Series.
- JMA and NIED links are official provider pages. The app does
  not scrape them; it only accepts user-uploaded comparison tables.
- For papers, figures, printed handouts, or static
  exports, re-check each tile provider's current terms and required attribution.
- Coastline data used for plotting were derived from Natural Earth public domain vector data.

## API Usage

The USGS data loader is implemented in `envgeo_utils.py`.

```python
from datetime import datetime, timezone

import envgeo_utils

df = envgeo_utils.load_usgs_earthquake_data(
    starttime=datetime(2026, 1, 1, tzinfo=timezone.utc),
    endtime=datetime(2026, 1, 31, tzinfo=timezone.utc),
    minmagnitude=4.5,
    mindepth=0,
    maxdepth=700,
    minlatitude=20,
    maxlatitude=50,
    minlongitude=120,
    maxlongitude=155,
    limit=2000,
    orderby="time",
)
```

Returned columns include:

- `EventID`
- `DateTime_UTC`
- `Time_UTC`
- `Longitude_degE`
- `Latitude_degN`
- `Depth_km`
- `Magnitude`
- `MagnitudeType`
- `Place`
- `URL`

The generated USGS query URL is stored in:

```python
df.attrs["query_url"]
```

---

## Maintenance Notes

README files, Home update history, and `docs/` are maintained together with
code changes. Update them when user-facing behavior, page names, data sources,
citations, limitations, testing workflow, or the EnvGeo-Seawater relationship
changes.

The usual workflow is to edit and verify the working folder first, then copy
the checked source/docs/test files to the Git clone for commit and push. Do not
copy generated caches, virtual environments, or local runtime artifacts.

---

## Reproducibility and Caching

USGS earthquake queries are made through explicit URL parameters and the query
URL is displayed in the app. Downloaded results can be exported as CSV.

Streamlit caching is used to reduce repeated API access. Cached USGS earthquake
queries use a time-to-live of 1 hour, and plate-boundary queries use a
time-to-live of 24 hours. The sidebar includes a cache-clear/reload button.

Because earthquake catalogs can be revised, exact reproduced results may change
when USGS updates event parameters or when a query is rerun at a later date.

---

## Limitations

- This app is not an official alert or disaster-response product.
- USGS event data may be preliminary and may be revised.
- The USGS FDSN event service has a 20,000-event query limit.
- Large global queries can be slow in the browser because many points are drawn
  interactively.
- Plotly 3D interaction is best on a PC; 2D maps are recommended for
  smartphones and tablets.
- Plate boundaries are approximate context lines.
- JMA/NIED comparison depends on user-uploaded data and user-side compliance
  with provider terms.
- Local coastline reference files are used only for visualization context.
